NAME Laptop Tablet Screen Supports

DESCRIPTION

A pair of 3D printed laptop supports aimed at maintaining my laptop's screen at a specific angle when in tablet mode.

BACKGROUND

This mini project came about when I realized that my current desktop set up was really just uncomfortable. For reference, my laptop has the ability to be folded into a tablet with touchscreen capabilities, which I often use to take notes and complete homework. However, in the past month of school, I found that due to the natural design of the device, I'd be writing on a slight downward incline away from me. Moreover, constantly looking up and down from my tablet to my monitor sometimes led to unnecessary dizziness and neck strains. 

With a little bit of spare time over reading week, I decided to put my 3D design skills to the test to tackle this problem. I thought that this would be an interesting challenge, as it was a problem unique to only me, meaning I had free reign over the design, constraints, and objectives. 

DESIGN METHODOLOGY

As per the engineering methodology which I had learned in my program's 1P13 project course, I started by laying the groundwork for my project through establishing objectives, functions, and constraints:

Function: Hold the laptop screen at a desired angle to prevent rotational motion

Objectives:
- Sturdy
- Extremely Portable
- Sleek/Minimalistic
- Adjustable

Constraints:
- No hard constraints other than being able to fit in my school bag and have a print time under 2 hours

With this project, there were several key aspects which I had to consider before developing a test model:

1. The bottom of the laptop, where the screen would fold into, has very little definative features which would be able to support and hold a contraption in place
With this obstacle in mind, I figured that I had three main options for a solid support structure. My options were to use clips on either side, use a form of friction grip, or make use of the rubber stoppers. With careful consideration and testing, I found that the first option would be too intrusive and potentially damage my device and the second would require external resources that I did not have available at the time. With the third option, I developed a quick test model to see whether something was viable.

This little creation makes use of the edges of the stoppers. One thing that I was worried about was how thin the stoppers were, meaning slight movement in the Y axis would cause the support to lose its stability. Therefore, my goal was to focus as much force downwards as possible.

Later on, structures were added to the base to support a potential arm.

2. The decision on whether or not to have adjustable height/angle options
After several tests and trials, I concluded that having the ability to change the height or angle of the laptop screen would be an unnecessary complex task to design. Using some clothes as cushions, I tested for a comfortable angle that I would be able to take notes on for prolonged periods of time. Once this sweet spot was found, I used basic trigonometry to calculate the angle at which the screen was situated.  

My reasoning for having a linear model was that once I got used to a certain position, I'd rarely ever change it anyways. Having moving parts or modular components would make this project less portable for when I used it in a public setting.

After creating an appropriate height, I also added a flat section at the end of the arm. The purpose of this was to help spread the pressure of my hands when writing and focus it onto the center of the arm, which later redirects said force right into the base of the rubber stopppers. In addition, having a larger surface area increases friction, which would reduce slippage.

ASSEMBLY
With two seperate components of the build, I decided to seperate them into their own 3D models. This would allow for final changes such as height and angle to be adjusted without possible interfereing with other aspects of the overall build.

Using Autodesk Inventor's assembly mode, I created the following setup:

I've attached the .stl and inventor files for anyone that wants to print it. The filemaps are for one rest, so you'd have to print it twice. [laptopsupports.zip](https://github.com/leer78/Laptop-Supports/files/7356602/laptopsupports.zip)
